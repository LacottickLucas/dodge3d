# Dodge3D
Small project to start studying 3d games, exploring basic movements, animations, collision and other functionalities.
I have used the models disponibilized by [GDQuest](https://www.youtube.com/@Gdquest) on their 3d character models [repository](https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-4-3D-Characters/tree/main)
